# Mitro API

This repository is a mirror of the [Mitro API folder](https://github.com/mitro-co/mitro/tree/master/browser-ext/api/js/cli).

It is convenient in order to download their Javascript API apart of the entire project. If **mitro** team ever decide to break their repo into multiple packages this should no longer be necessary but until then I'll try to keep this repository up-to-date as a viable alternative.

## Instal it using NPM

Should be as simple as:

```shell
npm install --save git+https://github.com/ruyadorno/mitro-js.git
```

If you need more information, please visit [Mitro official repository](https://github.com/mitro-co/mitro).
